15.0 TERM AND TERMINATION

15.1 This Agreement shall be effective on the date this Agreement is duly executed by the parties and shall remain in force for five (5) years or until expiration of the last to expire copyright for the Code and Documentation prepared pursuant to a Phase II Document, whichever is later. However, both parties agree that no Phase I Attachment or Phase II Document executed after five (5) years have passed from due execution of this Agreement shall have any force and effect unless and until the parties have amended, in writing, this Section.

15.2.2 In addition, IBM may terminate a Phase II Document, at any point prior to acceptance of Final Code and Documentation, in whole or part, without cause upon ten (10) days written notice to MS. In such case, IBM's entire liability to MS shall be to pay MS for work completed through termination and the amount stated in such Phase II Document for IBM's termination other than for material breach by MS. This paragraph is inapplicable if IBM terminates for MS's material breach of its obligations under any Phase II Document or in conjunction with IBM's rejection of Code and Documentation.

15.2.3 In the event of any termination or expiration of an Attachment and/or Document in whole or in part:
(a) The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall survive;

Further, the provisions regarding ownership, but not the licensing provisions, of Subsection 3.2.5 shall survive and, any other obligations, but not other licenses, that, by their nature, extend beyond such termination shall survive according to their terms.
(e) With respect to the Attachment and/or Document or portion of the Attachment and/or Document terminated, both parties shall deliver to the other, and the other shall take possession of, an archival copy of all Code and Documentation and, with respect to Phase I, the output then in progress and both parties shall make any payments due the other, if any, pursuant to such Attachment and/or Document or portion of Attachment and/or Document so terminated, for the work satisfactorily performed up to the date of termination and, if applicable, the payment for termination other than for material breach, as set forth in Subsection 15.2.2; and
(f) In the event of termination for material breach, with respect to the Attachment and/or Document or portion of Attachment and/or Document terminated, the pro-rata share of any advance payments made by either party to the other to which the other is not entitled, as negotiated by the parties is good faith, shall be returned to the advancing party, taking into account the work completed, if any; and

16.0 GENERAL

16.1 In the event that MS desires to use the services of any third parties who are not employees of MS in its performance under this Agreement, MS shall provide IBM with written notice of the third parties identities and the tasks to be performed. If IBM does not object to the use of such third parties for the described tasks within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, MS may employ such third party for the described tasks, provided MS first obtains from such third party a written agreement sufficient to enable MS to comply with all of its obligations under this Agreement and provided further that the written notice required hereunder is sent by MS to the address identified in, and in accordance with the terms of, Section 16.18 of this Agreement and identifies that it is sent pursuant to this Section 16.1.

16.2 Each party shall have full freedom and flexibility in its marketing effort of the sublicensing, sale or other transfer of the Code and Documentation produced pursuant to Phase II Document(s) (including, without limitation, whether to market or to discontinue marketing, its method of marketing, terms and conditions and pricing), and/or Derivative Works thereof. Neither party makes any guarantee or commitment hereby as to the success of such marketing effort, and both parties agree that the other party has no obligation whatsoever with respect to this Agreement other than as specifically provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MS agrees not to place the IBM copyright notice on any products marketed by MS. MS will, however, place its copyright notice on any such products in a manner sufficient to protect IBM's underlying copyright.

16.3 Except as provided with respect to copyright registration in the Section of this Agreement entitled "Copyright", nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize or empower either party or its Subsidiaries to act as an agent for the other party or to conduct business in the name of the other party.

16.4 Personnel supplied by MS to perform services for the purposes of this Agreement will be deemed employees of MS and will not for any purpose be considered employees or agents of IBM. MS assumes full responsibility for the actions of such personnel while performing services hereunder, and shall be solely responsible for their supervision, daily direction and control, payment of salary (including withholding of income and FICA taxes), worker's compensation, disability benefits, and the like.

16.5 Personnel supplied by IBM to perform services for the purposes of this Agreement will be deemed employees of IBM and will not for any purposes be considered employees or agents of MS. IBM assumes full responsibility for the actions of such of its personnel while performing services hereunder, and shall be solely responsible for their supervision, daily direction and control, payment of salary (including withholding of income and FICA taxes), worker's compensation, disability benefit, and the like.

16.6 The titles of the Sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and do not in any way limit or amplify the provisions of this Agreement.

16.7 This Agreement shall in no way preclude either party from independently developing or acquiring materials and programs which are competitive, irrespective of their similarity, with the Code and Documentation or from making similar arrangements with others.

16.8 Both parties represent and warrant that they have no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

16.9 Neither party shall give or offer gifts or gratuities of any type to the employees of the other or to members of their families that are intended to improperly influence or may create the appearance of improperly influencing the relationship between IBM and MS.

16.10 MS shall maintain comprehensive general liability insurance for claims for damages because of bodily injury (inclusive of death) and property damage caused by, or arising out of, acts or omissions of its employees. The minimum limits of such insurance shall be one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for each accident because of bodily injury; and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) because of property damage for each accident. Certificate of such insurance shall be furnished to IBM at the commencement of this Agreement and at the renewal date of such insurance policy for as long as and during the period that any obligations under the Phase I Attachments or Phase II Documents remain in effect. In no event shall the insurance be cancelled during such period without prior written notice to IBM by MS. This provision shall in no way act as a limitation of any MS liability with respect to the subject matter of the insurance, or otherwise.

16.11 This Agreement, along with all of its Phase I Attachments and Phase II Documents, may not be changed or amended in any manner without the duly authorized written consent of both parties.

16.12 There are incorporated into this Agreement the provisions of Executive Order #11246 (as amended) of the President of the United States on Equal Employment Opportunity and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. Each party represent that it will comply with this order and pertinent rules and regulations, unless exempted.

16.13 Except as otherwise specifically required for the purposes of Subsection 3.2.1(e), nothing in this Agreement shall require either party or its Subsidiaries to identify its or their customers to the other. IBM may, at its option, identify the Code and Documentation, and/or Derivative Works thereof, as having been developed by MS and may use the name of MS in its advertising of the Code and Documentation and IBM products which incorporates the Code and Documentation; provided that IBM shall take reasonable steps to modify any such advertising if MS objects to the manner in which its name is used. However, MS shall have no right to identify the Code and Documentation, and/or Derivative Works thereof, as having been developed by IBM except with respect to such items which IBM is marketing.

16.14 At the time of or after the effective date of this Agreement, IBM agrees to review and consider requests by MS to issue MS press releases mentioning MS's involvement with this Agreement. The contents of such proposed release(s) shall be consistent with the provisions of the Section entitled "Disclosure of Information" and IBM's practices concerning endorsements. IBM's approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

16.15 Neither party shall sell, delegate, transfer or assign any right or obligation hereunder, except as expressly provided herein, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent may be granted or withheld at the sole discretion of such other party. Any attempted act in derogation of the foregoing shall be null and void.

16.16 Both parties agree to comply, and do all the things necessary for each to comply with all applicable, Federal, State, and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including but not limited to the Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce relating to the Export of Technical Data, insofar as they relate to this Agreement. Both parties agree to obtain any required government documents and approvals prior to exporting any technical data disclosed or developed under this Agreement and any product to which such data relate.

16.17 Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice required or permitted to be made by or given to either party hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall be sufficiently made or given on the date of mailing if sent to the receiving party by certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to it at its address set forth below, or to such other address as it shall designate by written notice given to the other party:

16.18 MS agrees that for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the services performed for IBM shall be deemed entirely within MS's responsibility. MS will notify IBM promptly, in writing, if a charge of non-compliance with the Act has been filed against MS in connection with services being performed on IBM-owned or leased premises.

16.19 If the performance of this Agreement or of any obligation hereunder is prevented, restricted or interfered with by reason of fire or other casualty or accident; strikes or labor disputes, inability to procure raw materials, equipment, power or supplies; war or other violence; any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand or requirement of any governmental agency or intergovernmental body; or any other act or condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of the parties hereto the party so affected, upon giving notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference; provided that the party so affected shall use reasonable efforts under the circumstances to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and shall continue performance hereunder promptly whenever such causes are removed.

16.20 No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. In the event that any provision shall be severed, the entire Agreement shall not fail on account thereof, and the balance of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

16.21 IBM endeavors to provide a safe environment free from violence and threats of violence for all of its employees, customers and licensees to its premises.

16.22 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or other joint business entity between the parties hereto.

16.23 The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall supersede and replace any contrary terms contained in any prior agreement between MS and IBM regarding the disclosure of MS Code to the extent that any MS Code subject to such prior agreements is made applicable to this Agreement by a Phase II Document.

16.24 The foregoing provisions, Phase I Attachments, and Phase II Documents constitute the entire agreement concerning the subject matter hereof between the parties and shall supersede all prior agreements, oral or written, and all other communications between them relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, except to the extent expressly modified by the terms of this Agreement, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement dated August 21, 1983 and the Equipment Loan Agreement dated May 12, 1983 between the parties shall remain in full force and effect.

16.25 This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
