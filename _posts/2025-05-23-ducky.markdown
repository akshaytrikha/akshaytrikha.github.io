A few weeks ago I thought I was bothering my coworker by calling him to help debug something too often. In two separate conversations I exclaimed because I knew exactly what my bug was without him having said a word on the call - and felt embarassed as he laughed at me through the computer sceen. 

I thought what if I could create an AI rubber ducky that I could call instead of him?

In my head I wanted to create a UX where I could talk to the rubber ducky and it would both be able to hear me and see the code that I was talking about, just like a Zoom call with your coworker.

To test if this is useful I created a dummy codebase for training a simple vision tranformer for classification on a small subset of the [CIFAR-100](https://huggingface.co/datasets/uoft-cs/cifar100) dataset. I introduced a small bug in the `init()` of the model:

❌ `num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) * (img_size // patch_size - 1)`\\
✅ `num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) * (img_size // patch_size)`\\

and asked my friend to use the AI rubber ducky to help him debug what was going wrong.

Future features:
- Visualize debugging path attempts
- Integrate with Cursor / GitHub Copilot
